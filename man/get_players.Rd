\description{
Retrieves current and historical player data from stats.nba.com
}
\details{
Retrieves basic information about players that stats.nba.com contains in
their dataset for a given \code{league} and  given \code{season}. Basic
information is the player's current team, and their first and final
years in the league and so on. The \code{team_id} and \code{person_id} values
returned should be unique for each team and player respectively, so these are
useful keys to other data.

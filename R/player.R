#' Retrieves current and historical player data from stats.nba.com

#' @details
#' Retrieves basic information about players that stats.nba.com contains in

#' information is the player's current team, and their first and final
#' years in the league and so on. The \code{team_id} and \code{person_id} values
#' returned should be unique for each team and player respectively, so these are
#' useful keys to other data.

#' Get player biography data
#'
#' @description
#' Retrieves the player biography data from stats.nba.com subject to the
#' filters recognised by statsnbaR, and returns it as a data.frame.
#'
#' @details
#' Provides player data given as per-season measurements. For a given league and
#' season, this will return basic and advanced statistics for all the active
#' players.
#'
#' The query filters are constructed by the \code{\link{filter_bio}} function.
#' The list of filters available is given in the documentation for that
#' constructor. The units that the values/data is aggregated into is determined
#' by the \code{per} filter, which can be set to either \code{total} for the
#' total values or \code{game} for per-game values. This won't affect the
#' percentage statistics returned.
#' 
#' The filters may include season segments, such as the playoffs,
#' date filters or versus opponents and so on, and the values returned will
#' reflect the performance and data collected in only those selected periods
#' or whatever filter is applied.
